<!-- Jeff - COMMENT #1 - You are training yourself how to use ZURB.com's
"Foundation 6 for Sites" in order to build v1 of a REVAMPED BraLady International
web site. You spoke with the Founder of ZURB - Bryan Zmijewski - serendipitously,
when you called their phone number after reading their email subscription welcome
email. You liked him and have emails with him. In fact, you ran him through several
slides over a Skype. Although he didn't want to 'partner' and put his own professional
resources on the project (FREE, up-front) with you he sounded sincere in wanting
to be kept up-to-date with the progress. Do that. Keep him up-to-date. Below are
his details. He's a Minnesota native living near San Jose now.

<!-- Jeff - COMMENT #2 - You are learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as
PHP, Apache, and MySQL so that you can do all of this yourself and eventually
teach the boys if and as it makes sense. You are following this guy - Gary Jennings
- using his YouTube 12-part series which can be found at this YouTube web site
https://youtu.be/WlqTTBul7ik -->

<!-- Jeff - COMMENT #3 - use the Ctrl+/ to instantly start a comment. Cool. Easy.
It's how I did this exact comment! -->
<!-- Jeff - COMMENT #4 - Gary sets up four titles in #2 of his series for each
of his four sections 'DESKTOP NAVIGATION', 'HERO SECTION', 'MAIN SECTION' and
'FOOTER' which I've also added throughout the code below -->

<!-- DESKTOP NAVIGATION -->

<!--  Jeff - you're going to have to potentially edit the # in the list items below. For
more information, go here http://javascript.about.com/od/hintsandtips/a/invalidhrefs.htm -->

  <div class="top-bar">
    <div class="top-bar-left">
      <ul class="dropdown menu" data-dropdown-menu>
        <li class="top-bar-left-logo"><img src="BLI logo simple 150px wide BORDERED PINK.png" alt="BraLady logo"/></li>
        <!-- Jeff - You just removed this line as it as not needed
        and was screwing up the spacing between the log and "Get Fitted" to the immediate right of it.
        You can see what you mean by simply removing the comment code on either end of this comment.
        <li class="menu-text"></li> -->
